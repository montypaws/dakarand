Initial release.  Run "sh build.sh" to build scrypt and compile dakarand
against it.

Code's fairly intentionally being left difficult to integrate into production,
i.e. use of globals, dependencies on both scrypt and openssl, etc.
I'll make a cleaner version after this thing has been put through its paces
(seriously, the approach is not supposed to work).
